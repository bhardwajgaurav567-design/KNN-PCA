        ">> A. K-Nearest Neighbors(KNN) is simple, non-parametric, supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is also known as an instance-based or lazy learning algorithm because it does not build an explicit model during training; instead, it stores the entire training dataset and makes predictions only at the time of querying by comparing the new data point to the stored instances.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Calculate distance- For a new (test) data point, compute its distance to all points in the training dataset. The most common distance metric is Euclidean distance, but others like Manhattan, Minkowski, or weighted distances can also be used.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Identify K nearest neighbors- Select the K training points that are closet to the test point (smallest distances).\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Make prediction- Aggregate the information from these K neighbors to predict the output for the test point.\n",

        "\n",
        "> KNN predicts the class label of the test point.\n",
        "\n",
        "> It uses majority voting (or plurality voting when these are more than two classes): the class that appears most frequantly among the K nearest neighbors is assigned to the test point.\n",
        "\n",
        "> Ties can be broken randomly or by giviing more weight to closer neighbors (weighted voting, where nearer neighbors contribute more).\n",

        "\n",
        "> KNN predicts a continuous numerical value.\n",

        "> It takes the average (mean) ofthe targett values of the K nearest neighbors.\n",

        "> Optionally, it can use a weighted average, where closer neighbors have higher weights (e.g., inverse of distance).\n",

        "\n",
